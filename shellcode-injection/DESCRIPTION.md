Welcome to **Shellcode Injection**, the deeper dive (beyond what you learned in Introductory [Binary Exploitation](https://pwn.college/intro-to-cybersecurity/binary-exploitation/)) into the choreography of code execution, where you don't just tap into the rhythm of a system, but you take the lead, guiding the entire ensemble of processes, threads, and instructions.

Once the gates of execution are breached, what follows?
Is it the end of the battle, or merely the beginning of a symphony?
How does one communicate with the very core of a machine, dictating its every move, turning threats into opportunities, limitations into launching pads?

For the hackers among us, the dance begins with shellcode.
But mastering this dance isn't about merely memorizing steps; it's about improvisation, anticipation, and adaptation.

Throughout this module, you'll dive deep into:
- **Execution Environments**: Navigate the different arenas your shellcode might be thrown into, from the predictable world of memory allocation to the wild terrains of stack-based randomness.
- **Filters & Constraints**: Often, the dance floor isn't clear. There might be traps set up, from the dreaded 'H' bytes checker to the cunning bubblesort sorter, ready to trip your shellcode up. Can you weave through these obstacles, adjusting your steps on the fly?
- **Shellcoding Techniques**: With the right steps, even the most intricate of routines can be bypassed. Master techniques such as nop sleds, self-modifying code, position-independent practices, and the cunning of two-stage shellcodes to remain unstoppable.

Dancing with a processor isn't just about knowing the steps, but understanding the language and semantics of each instruction.
While you'll have the stage to yourself, we ensure you're never alone on this journey.
Equip yourself with these invaluable scrolls of wisdom:
- [x64.syscall.sh](https://x64.syscall.sh): Your cheat sheet for syscalls. A glance here, and you're always ahead.
- [Syscalls Manpage](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html): Understand not just the calls, but their deeper implications.
- [Felix Cloutier](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/): Dive into the heartbeats of instructions, ensuring you're always in step.    
- [x86asm Reference](http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html): Decode the bytes into moves, turning the tables on any challenge.

As you embark on this journey, remember, it's not just about taking control; it's about finesse, elegance, and the joy of the dance.
In the vast assembly halls of x64, the processor awaits your cue.
So, put on your dancing shoes, and let's speak the language of the processor!
